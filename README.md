## Project: bearer-auth

### Author: Marco Villafana

### Problem Domain  

Server allows user to create an account as well as to handle Basic Authentication (user provides a username + password). When a “good” login happens, the user is considered to be “authenticated” and our auth-server generates a JWT signed “Token” which is returned to the application. Using that Token to re-authenticate users we will shield access to any route that requires a valid login to access.
